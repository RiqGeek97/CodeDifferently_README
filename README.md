About Me
Hello there! I'm Tyriq Johnson (aka RiqGeek97), and I'm delighted to welcome you to my GitHub profile. Here, you'll find a glimpse into my world of coding and creativity.

What Drives Me
I am a firm believer in the power of mornings. There's something magical about the dawn that energizes me and sets the tone for the rest of the day. I thrive in the tranquility of the early hours, where the world is just waking up, and possibilities seem endless.

My Coding Philosophy
Much like the sunrise, I approach coding with a sense of optimism and enthusiasm. I believe in starting each project with a clear vision and a fresh perspective, leveraging the quiet hours of the morning to dive deep into problem-solving and exploration.
