# Hi, my name is... Tyriq Johnson üòÅ

Thank you and welcome to my README! This will be a mix of personal and professional info, so that you can get to know me.

## Lets Start!

First I would to start off by letting you know some of the things that I love. First, would have to be FAMILY! That is my No.1 thing. Without my blood and my girlfriend I would not be the man that I am today. Second, has to be is music! I personally, love all sorts of music, doesn't matter if it's Hiphop, Jazz, Techno, or even Country (yes, I really do like country music). If the music is well composed or has a great vibe to it, then I am for it! Third thing that I love is learning through others and experiences in order to teach others. I am a firm believer that if everyone comes together as one, then we can accomplish anything! Passing down knowledge essentially the best way to put it. Last but not least is VIDEO GAMES. I am a sucker for Fortnite. I have currently over 300+ hours played on that game alone. Whenever I have free time, I am most likely on that game trying to get better.
